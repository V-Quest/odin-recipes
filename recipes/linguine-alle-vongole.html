	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Linguine alle vongole is one of the most famous Italian seafood pasta dishes, and for good reason. The wonderful flavor of the sea comes through with the pasta, heightened with garlic, wine, and peperoncino. It is also a very easy dish to prepare, making it a wonderful addition to anyones regular recipes</p>

	<h2>Red or Whtie?</h2>
	<p>Pasta with clams is traditionally prepared red or white(rosso o bianco); with tomatoes and basil or without. This recipe will follow the white version because that is my personal favorite and will serve four people.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Linguine: 16oz</li>
		<li>Fresh clams(vongola verace or manila): 2lbs</li>
		<li>Garlic: 5 cloves</li>
		<li>Dried red pepper flakes: To taste</li>
		<li>Extra virgin olive oil: 4-5 tbsp</li>
		<li>Fresh italian parsley: 1 handful</li>
		<li>Salt: To taste</li>
		<li>White wine: 1 glass</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Soak the clams in salt water for 30 minutes to an hour, remove clams from water and rise them through running water, discard any clams that are open prior to cooking.</li>
		<li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the linguine and cook until a few minutes short of al dente. Strain and reserve a few cups of the pasta water</li>
		<li>Mince the garlic and parsley, add garlic and olive oil to skillet and place on low heat. Cook until garlic gains some color but make sure it doesn't brown. Add red pepper flakes, clams, and white wine. Cover the skillet with lid and set heat to high until the contents start to boil, then set heat to low and cook until alcohol is cooked out and clams open.</li>
		<li>Remove clams from skillet and add the strained pasta and a cup of the pasta water. Set heat to high and stir constantly until pasta is cooked, add additional pasta water if the sauce becomes too dry. Add the chopped parsley to the skillet then turn off the head and add the clams back in.</li>
	</ol>
